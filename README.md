# Raspberry Pi Pico WH - AM Radio Transmitter

This is project shows how to generate an AM radio transmission on any carrier frequency; 530kHz in the Portal Radio Example.

ConvertWavToArr.py | Converts Unsigned 8-bit PCM wav files into an array of audio data for the Pi

PortalRadio_AM_Send.ino | Sends Portal Radio Music through Pin 15 Constantly on loop

You need a Raspberry Pi Pico (Any other microcontroller might work too) and a wire as antenna connected to pin 15
